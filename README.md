**Red Black Tree:
**
Allows for insertions to generate Red Black Tree. Example for set (7, 4, 2, 5, 6) provided below. I would like to credit[ the following online resource](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html) to helping me understand Red Black Trees, as well as also being a helpful tool to confirm proper functionality

**Skip List:**

Functional skip list. In this case I inserted the values within the first 3 lines. then deleted 20, then inserted 20 and -1. To understand the formatting, imagine that the rows are inverted (i.e. the first entry would have 80 on the top row).
